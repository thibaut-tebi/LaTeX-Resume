### Resume in LaTeX 

This repository contains the LaTeX code for my Resume. I have used LaTeX to create a professional and well-formatted document that showcases my skills, qualifications, and experience.

## Usage
To use this LaTeX Resume template, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have LaTeX installed on your system. If not, you can install it from LaTeX Project.
3. Open the cv.tex file in a LaTeX editor of your choice (e.g., TeXstudio, Overleaf, etc.).
4. Customize the content according to your personal information, including your name, contact details, education, work experience, skills, etc.
5. Compile the document using a LaTeX compiler to generate the PDF version of your resume.
6. Feel free to modify the LaTeX code and adapt it to suit your needs. You can change the formatting, layout, or add additional sections as required.
